## Simple and easy to use turn timer
A new timer bar is added to the combat tracker visible to all users that displays how much time is left for the current acting player to take their turn. Options allow various alert visual and audio cues to be given along with automatically advancing to the next combat turn upon time running out.

## TODO
- [ ] Add more styles of timer bar. (more detailed CSS options? Radial timer?)
- [ ] Add popout timer bar / alert window.
